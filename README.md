# sheet_loader_localization

## Sheet Localization Generator

Download CSV file and generates the localization keys from an online Google Sheet to working
with [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization)
and [easy_localization_loader](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization_loader)

This tool inspired
by [flutter_sheet_localization_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sheet_localization_generator)
and the original author [RinLV](https://github.com/rinlv)

### üî© Installation

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  easy_localization: <last_version>
  easy_localization_loader: <last_version>

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: <last_version>
  sheet_loader_localization: <last_version>
```

### üîå Usage

#### 1. Create a CSV Google Sheet

Create a sheet with your translations (following the bellow
format, [an example sheet is available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v2Y3e0Uvn0JTwHvsduNT70u7Fy9TG43DIcZYJxPu1ZA/edit?usp=sharing)) :

![csv example file](https://github.com/Hoang-Nguyenn/sheet_loader_localization/raw/main/csv_example.png)

Make sure that your sheet is shared :

![share](https://github.com/Hoang-Nguyenn/sheet_loader_localization/raw/main/share.png)

Extract from the link the `DOCID`
value : `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<DOCID>/edit?usp=sharing`) :

#### 2. Declare a localization delegate

Declare the following `_LocaleKeys` class with the `SheetLocalization` annotation pointing to your
sheet in a `lib/utils/multi-languages/locale_keys.dart` file :

```dart
import 'dart:ui';

import 'package:sheet_loader_localization/sheet_loader_localization.dart';

part 'locale_keys.g.dart';

@SheetLocalization(
  docId: 'DOCID',
  version: 1,
  // the `1` is the generated version.
  //You must increment it each time you want to regenerate a new version of the labels.
  outDir: 'resources/langs',
  //default directory save downloaded CSV file
  outName: 'langs.csv',
  //default CSV file name
  preservedKeywords: [],)
class _LocaleKeys {}
```

#### 3. Generate your localizations

Run the following command to generate a `lib/utils/multi-languages/locale_keys.dart` file :

```
flutter pub run build_runner build

or 

flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Sample
of [locale_keys.g.dart](https://github.com/Hoang-Nguyenn/sheet_loader_localization/blob/main/example/lib/utils/multi-languages/locale_keys.g.dart)

#### 4. Configure your app

Last, config step by step following this tutorial
from [README.md of easy_localization ](https://github.com/aissat/easy_localization/blob/develop/README.md)

### ‚ö° Regeneration

Because of the caching system of the build_runner, it can't detect if there is a change on the
distant sheet and it can't know if a new generation is needed.

The `version` parameter of the `@SheetLocalization` annotation solves this issue.

Each time you want to trigger a new generation, simply increment that version number and call the
build runner again.

### Why‚ùìÔ∏è

I find the [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) has
already [Code generation](https://github.com/aissat/easy_localization/blob/develop/README.md#-code-generation)
, but it doesn't support working with Google Sheet and generate keys from CSV file and some library don't support flutter 2.0 null-safety. So, I update this simple generator tool.
